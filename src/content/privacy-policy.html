<h2>5. Data Security</h2>
<p>We take the security of your personal information seriously. We implement reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards designed to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure. These safeguards include:</p>

    <li>Confidentiality agreements with employees, contractors, and service providers who access personal information</li>
    <li>Periodic review of our data security practices</li>
</ul>

<p>However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to protect your information using commercially reasonable means, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

<h2>8. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
<p>Depending on your location, you may have certain rights regarding your personal information:</p>

<h3>8.1 Access</h3>
<p>You may request access to the personal information we hold about you.</p>

<h3>8.2 Correction</h3>
<p>You may request that we correct inaccurate or incomplete personal information.</p>

<h3>8.3 Deletion</h3>
<p>You may request that we delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions required by law or legitimate business purposes (such as maintaining records for tax compliance, completing transactions, or defending legal claims).</p>

<h3>8.4 Data Portability</h3>
<p>Where technically feasible, you may request a copy of your personal information in a structured, commonly used, machine-readable format.</p>

<h3>8.5 Opt-Out of Marketing</h3>
<p>You may opt out of receiving promotional emails by clicking the "unsubscribe" link in any marketing email or by contacting us directly. Please note:</p>

    <li>You may still receive transactional emails related to your bookings, inquiries, or contractual relationship (such as booking confirmations, payment receipts, and event reminders)</li>
    <li>Opt-out requests may take up to 10 business days to process</li>

<h3>8.6 Photo/Video Removal</h3>
<p>If you appear in photographs or videos we have used for marketing purposes and wish to have them removed, please contact us with sufficient detail to identify the content.

<h3>8.7 Cookie Preferences</h3>
<p>You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings, our cookie consent tools (if available), or third-party opt-out mechanisms described in Section 1.4.</p>

<h3>8.8 Do Not Track Signals</h3>
<p>Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that sends a signal to websites you visit. Our website does not currently respond to DNT signals because there is no uniform industry standard for interpreting DNT. However, you can manage tracking preferences through the methods described in Section 1.4.</p>

<h3>8.9 Identity Verification</h3>
<p>To protect your privacy and security, we require verification of your identity before we process requests to access, correct, or delete your personal information. Verification may include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Confirming information associated with your booking or account (such as event date, email address, phone number, or booking reference number)</li>
    <li>In some cases, providing government-issued identification</li>
</ul>
<p>We will not fulfill data requests if we cannot reasonably verify that the requestor is the individual whose data is being requested, or an authorized representative. We will inform you if we cannot verify your identity and explain what additional information is needed.</p>

<h3>8.10 How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
<p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the information in Section 13. We will acknowledge your request within 10 business days and provide a substantive response within 45 days. If we need additional time (up to an additional 45 days for complex requests), we will notify you of the extension and the reason.</p>
